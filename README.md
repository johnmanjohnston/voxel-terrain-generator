# voxel-terrain-generator
A voxel terrain generator, made using Unity, and C#

This was made using Unity (version 2021.1.14f1), with C#. 
It uses [FastNoiseLite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite), which is used to generate the noise. It then generates terrain accordingly.
It also has a player controller which lets you navigate through the generated terrain.
On the Generator GameObject, you have the options to specify a width, height, and a seed, which are used to generate the noise, which is used to generate the terrain.

## Progress
